                arms, legs and core to strengthen and lengthen the body. Powered by energizing, heart-pumping music that
                makes you need to move, this class uses choreographed movement patterns with the support of a ballet
                barre  to take you through a flow of high-powered sequences that will keep you energized and motivated.

                The beauty about Pilates is that anybody can do it.  It is all about working and increasing core
                strength which will in turn help improve weaknesses in the lower back and create a stronger and better
                posture. As well as building strength, Pilates also increases flexibility.

                Flexibility can decrease as we get older,
                as can core strength purely down to every day life.  If you are sat at a desk all day, or have job that
                uses repetitive movements, chances are your posture will have suffered.  During my classes I offer
                plenty of alternatives, ranging from basic to more advanced moves.  It is essential that you only work
                to the level that you are comfortable with.  Pilates isn't a competition, it isn't about who can do the
                most advanced version of an exercise - its about who can perform it the most safely and effectively.

            My name is Kate Corbett and I am a fully qualified fitness instructor with REPS Level 3 status

            (find me on
            the REPS website, my number is R0086101. I initially trained as an Exercise to Music Instructor way back in
            2002 through the YMCA and shortly after qualified in Step, Aqua, Studio Resistance, Cardio Kick and
            Spinning.  I then decided in 2004 that I wanted to add Pilates to my list of qualifications.  I was
            intrigued to learn if the hype I was hearing about Pilates was true as I had began to suffer with lower
            back problems myself.  Nearly 10 years on and several Pilates classes later I still don't have any problems
            in my lower back! In early 2011, I qualified in teaching Health Related Exercise For Children prior to
            delivering theory and fitness sessions to obese families and their children.  I discovered during
            delivering these sessions that exercise should be all about having fun, if your not enjoying it, then you
            won't want to do it.  That is when I trained to be a Zumba instructor and I haven't looked back since!!
            I pride myself in trying to get participants to get the most out of their class experience with me.  I
            encourage you only to work at the ability that is suitable for YOU.  I have a wide range of clients, some
            that have been coming to me for years to some that have only joined me recently.  I treat everyone equally
            and make everybody feel welcome.  My aim is for you to leave the class with a smile on your face, come
            along and see for yourself ......
