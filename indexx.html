        <p>My name is Kate Corbett and I am a fully qualified fitness instructor with REPS Level 3 status (find me on the REPS website, my number is R0086101.

I initially trained as an Exercise to Music Instructor way back in 2002 through the YMCA and shortly after qualified in Step, Aqua, Studio Resistance, Cardio Kick and Spinning.  I then decided in 2004 that I wanted to add Pilates to my list of qualifications.  I was intrigued to learn if the hype I was hearing about Pilates was true as I had began to suffer with lower back problems myself.  Nearly 10 years on and several Pilates classes later I still don't have any problems in my lower back!!

In early 2011, I qualified in teaching Health Related Exercise For Children prior to delivering theory and fitness sessions to obese families and their children.  I discovered during delivering these sessions that exercise should be all about having fun, if your not enjoying it, then you won't want to do it.  That is when I trained to be a Zumba instructor and I haven't looked back since!!

I pride myself in trying to get participants to get the most out of their class experience with me.  I encourage you only to work at the ability that is suitable for YOU.  I have a wide range of clients, some that have been coming to me for years to some that have only joined me recently.  I treat everyone equally and make everybody feel welcome.  My aim is for you to leave the class with a smile on your face, come along and see for yourself ...... </p>
